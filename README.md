# Augmented-Reality-Convenience-App

## Introduction

### This is an Augmented Reality convenience application, which helps with basic activities for the day. 
### The application allows user to check the current time and weather in Toronto and this information will be showed in the form of 3D models appearing above the image target.

## Development
### The app is developed using Unity, C# and basic Vuforia integration. I spent around a month developing the project along with completing high school courses. The project is later on continued to be developed after two months of other projects.

## Challenges
### The hardest challenge is also the new lesson I learned about requesting API in Unity, which I have never tried before. The tough part is within the transfering the information from json file from API request into string in C#. I first got some issues with having the weather not displaying correctly (showing 0 degrees in none date) and that dragged the project development for a week of researching. I looked over some Youtube videos and got the answers from there, which I learned how to read JSON file and load information from online that file into variables in the WWW form of Unity Scripting AI.
### As a result, I successfully request weather information from Apixu website and display the models and weather broadcast successfully.

## Future Innovatiom
### The web view and music player is currently being developed. It will soon be released more.
